**[Update : Sep. 21st, 2023]** Companion has been redesigned to fit running as a cloud service,
and be used through mobile devices. See instruction to launch Companion on GitHub Codespaces
in the [documentation](https://shakedzy.xyz/companion).

Companion uses [OpenAI ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) & [Whisper](https://openai.com/research/whisper) and 
[Google Text-to-Speech](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech) & 
[Translate](https://translate.google.com/) to create your own personal
private tutor for learning a new foreign language. You can write, talk, read and listen 
in both your native language and selected foreign language. It's also configured to correct any mistakes you make.

Companion is distributed free of charge for any non-commercial usage. Note that the different APIs
and services used are not necessarily free, and might charge you based on your usage.
